# VEnt_NumericalTable
Illustration of how to use the turbulent entrainment model "VEnt".

UseTable.py:
This shows how to compare the interfacial velocity (J) results both from direct integration as well as interpolation from the numerical table.

To generate your own table you can start by looking at how to invoke the function that calculates J in the parmeter space in stead of k-epsilon-air-water space.

Details of the numerical table can be found in Appendix B of Yuan, B. (2022). **Bubble Entrainment and Transport with Application to Ship Hydrodynamics** (Doctoral dissertation, The University of Iowa).
